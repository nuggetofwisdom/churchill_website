                            <span>Water is essential for our health, yet</span>
                            <span>most of us still struggle to stay hydrated.</span>
                            <span>We chose distilled sparkling water as the foundation</span>
                            <span>of our Recovery Soda and enriched it with all-natural</span>
                            <span>ingredients that will allow you to hydrate</span>
                            more efficiently.

                            <span>Apart from nutritious fruits and herbs,</span>
                            <span>CHURCHILL contains salt. Contrary to popular belief,</span>
                            <span>salt is actually a hydration agent. It is an essential</span>
                            <span>mineral that helps you hydrate more efficiently.</span>
                            Our Recovery Soda relies on this secret ingredient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>To increase health benefits, we use</span>
                            <span>rose crystal salt which is mined at the foothills of</span>
                            <span>the Himalayan Mountains. It offers 80 more minerals</span>
                            <span>than regular salt, promotes increased absorption</span>
                            of nutrients, and helps to balance electrolytes.
                        </p>
                        <p class="f-italic">
                            <span>On top of that, we understand that an excess</span>
                            <span>of salt may impact your health. Therefore we also</span>
                            <span>made sure to add a healthy amount of salt to optimize</span>
                            <span>its effect. As a result Churchill offers neither to much,</span>
                            nor to little salt to keep you perfectly hydrated.

                            <span>A and Iron that allow your body to construct</span>
                            <span>oxygen transport proteins. These proteins</span>
                            supply our cells with oxygen.

                        <p>
                            <span>Moreover, mint is a strong source</span>
